### Abstract

<p align="justify">
Neural message passing algorithms for semi-supervised classification on graphs have recently achieved great success. However, these methods only consider nodes that are a few propagation steps away and the size of this utilized neighborhood cannot be easily extended. In this paper, we use the relationship between graph convolutional networks (GCN) and PageRank to derive an improved propagation scheme based on personalized PageRank. We utilize this propagation procedure to construct personalized propagation of neural predictions (PPNP) and its approximation, APPNP. Our model's training time is on par or faster and its number of parameters on par or lower than previous models. It leverages a large, adjustable neighborhood for classification and can be combined with any neural network. We show that this model outperforms several recently proposed methods for semi-supervised classification on multiple graphs in the most thorough study done so far for GCN-like models.</p>

A PyTorch and Tensorflow implementation is awailable [[here.]](https://github.com/klicperajo/ppnp).

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of PPNP and APPNP as described in the paper:

### Requirements
The codebase is implemented in Python 3.5.2. package versions used for development are just below.
```
networkx          2.4
tqdm              4.28.1
numpy             1.15.4
pandas            0.23.4
texttable         1.5.0
scipy             1.1.0
argparse          1.1.0
torch             1.1.0
torch-scatter     1.4.0
torch-sparse      0.4.3
torch-cluster     1.4.5
torch-geometric   1.3.2
torchvision       0.3.0
```
### Datasets
<p align="justify">
The code takes the **edge list** of the graph in a csv file. Every row indicates an edge between two nodes separated by a comma. The first row is a header. Nodes should be indexed starting with 0. A sample graph for `Cora` is included in the  `input/` directory. In addition to the edgelist there is a JSON file with the sparse features and a csv with the target variable.</p>
<p align="justify">
The **feature matrix** is a sparse binary one it is stored as a json. Nodes are keys of the json and feature indices are the values. For each node feature column ids are stored as elements of a list. The feature matrix is structured as:</p>

```javascript
{ 0: [0, 1, 38, 1968, 2000, 52727],
  1: [10000, 20, 3],
  2: [],
  ...
  n: [2018, 10000]}
```

The **target vector** is a csv with two columns and headers, the first contains the node identifiers the second the targets. This csv is sorted by node identifiers and the target column contains the class meberships indexed from zero. 

| **NODE ID**| **Target** |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 3 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 0 |
| 3 | 1 |
| ... | ... |
| n | 3 |
