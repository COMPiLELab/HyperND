**Overview of HyperGCN:** *Given a hypergraph and node features, HyperGCN approximates the hypergraph by a graph in which each hyperedge is approximated by a subgraph consisting of an edge between maximally disparate nodes and edges between each of these and every other node (mediator) of the hyperedge. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is then run on the resulting graph approximation. *

### Dependencies

- Compatible with PyTorch 1.0 and Python 3.x.
- For data (and/or splits) not used in the paper, please consider tuning hyperparameters such as [hidden size](https://github.com/malllabiisc/HyperGCN/blob/master/model/networks.py#L25), [learning rate](https://github.com/malllabiisc/HyperGCN/blob/master/config/config.py#L49), [seed](https://github.com/malllabiisc/HyperGCN/blob/master/config/config.py#L28), etc. on validation data.

### Training model (Node classifiction):

- To start training run:

  ```shell
  python hypergcn.py --mediators True --split 1 --data coauthorship --dataset dblp
  ```

  - `--mediators` denotes whether to use mediators (True) or not (False) 
  - `--split` is the train-test split number
